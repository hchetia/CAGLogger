# CAGLogger

Broad Goal-
Alignment free detection and tallying of CAG repeats from targeted Miseq data from HTT exon1 CAG repeat (Strategy- Mark Ciosi, Matlik et al 2023)
Generating a report with % of reads supporting the mutant allele (DONOR specific- to be acquired from Gensat)
% of reads supporting > 113 CAGs.

Catch- (Allow 1 mismatch per repeat structure).
